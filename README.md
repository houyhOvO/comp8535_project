## Overview  👀️

We choose Topic 5 Housing Price Prediction as our project.
We use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and
selected several main features. Then use linear regression,
random forest and other algorithms to train the model.
Finally, we develope a system based on [Streamlit](!https://streamlit.io/)
that can predict housing prices.

## Quickstart 🚀️

Make sure your libraries meet the requirements. Open a terminal and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
