## Overview  👀️

We choose Topic 5 Housing Price Prediction as our project.
We use [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and
selected several main features. Then use [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression),
[random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and other algorithms to train the model.
Finally, we develope a system based on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
that can predict housing prices.

## Quickstart 🚀️

Make sure your libraries meet the requirements.
After clone or download, open a terminal and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
